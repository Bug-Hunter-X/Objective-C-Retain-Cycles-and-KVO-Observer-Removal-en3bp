In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the intricacies of retain cycles.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end
```

If an instance of `MyClass` holds a strong reference to an instance of `AnotherClass`, and vice-versa, a retain cycle is created. Neither object can be deallocated, leading to memory leaks. This is especially problematic in long-running applications.

Another unusual error can occur with KVO (Key-Value Observing). If you don't remove observers correctly, you might end up with crashes or unexpected behavior after the observed object is deallocated. This is because the KVO system still tries to access the deallocated object.
